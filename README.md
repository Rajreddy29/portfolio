## Projects
### Big Data Analysis

Utilized big data analytics for large scale Spanish books using MapReduce and Spark, improving data processing speed by 30%.

### Traffic Control System using reinforcement learning
[Github link](https://github.com/shreshtagundoji/Traffic-Lights-Control-RL/blob/main/Final_Report.pdf)

Utilized reinforcement learning techniques to optimize traffic signal control in a simulated environment. It employs the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulation framework along with the Stable Baselines3 library for RL implementation, reducing vehicle wait times by 25%.
