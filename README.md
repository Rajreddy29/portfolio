## Projects
### Traffic Control System using reinforcement learning
[Github link](https://github.com/shreshtagundoji/Traffic-Lights-Control-RL/blob/main/Final_Report.pdf)

Utilized **Python** and **reinforcement learning** techniques to optimize traffic signal control in a simulated environment. It employs the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulation framework along with the Stable Baselines3 library for RL implementation, reducing vehicle wait times by 25%.

### Invoice Detection and Text Extraction
[Github link](https://github.com/shreshtagundoji/PaddleOCR-InvoiceDetection)

The application aims to develop an automated system for detecting and extracting information from receipts using **Computer Vision and NLP techniques** - PaddleOCR. The system will streamline the process of handling receipts by accurately identifying and extracting key details such as receipt number, date, total amount, and vendor information from scanned or digital receipts.
