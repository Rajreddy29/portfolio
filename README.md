## Projects
### Traffic Control System using reinforcement learning
[Github link](https://github.com/shreshtagundoji/Traffic-Lights-Control-RL/blob/main/Final_Report.pdf)

Utilized reinforcement learning techniques to optimize traffic signal control in a simulated environment. It employs the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulation framework along with the Stable Baselines3 library for RL implementation.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
